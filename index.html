            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet'.The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.</p>

            <p>The days and seasons are likewise comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are very similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.[18][19] Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids,] similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.

                    There are ongoing investigations assessing the past habitability potential of Mars, as well as the possibility of extant life. Future astrobiology missions are planned, including the Mars 2020 and Rosalind Franklin rovers. Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the Earth's, except at the lowest elevations for short periods. The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water.[29][30] The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a depth of 11 meters (36 ft). In November 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior.
                    
                    Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude reaches −2.94, which is surpassed only by Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. Optical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometers (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's atmosphere.</p>

            <h2>How did Mars get its name:</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is one of the terrestrial planets. It has a distinctive red color and was therefore associated with battles and war and named after the Roman god of war.

                    The surface of Mars is a reddish-brown color due to the rusting process of the surface minerals. Another name for Mars is “The Red Planet.” Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and Mars is the second smallest planet.
                    
                    Other civilizations throughout history have also named the planet due to its color. The Ancient Egyptians called Mars “Her Desher,” which translates to “the red one.”
                    
                    Today we often call Mars the “Red Planet” due to the iron minerals on the surface. It’s the iron in the Martian dirt that has oxidized or rusted that causes it to look red.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Structure and Surface</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The core at Mars’ center is very dense and is between 930 and 1,300 mi/1,500 to 2,100 km in radius.

                    The core is made up of iron, nickel and sulfur. Surrounding the core is the planet’s rocky mantle which is between 770-1,170 mi/1,240-1,880 km thick.
                    
                    Above the rocky mantle is the crust made up of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. The crust is between 6-30 mi/10-50 km deep.
                    
                    The Mars surface is divided by the hemisphere of the planet and is in two distinct types of features.</p>

            <h2>Space Missions to Mars:</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Of all of the planets and bodies in our solar system, Mars is the most explored and the only planet that we have sent rovers to travel the landscape and collect samples and data.

                    NASA, India, and ESA (European Space Agency) have spacecraft orbiting above Mars.
                    
                    The robotic explorers have found a lot of evidence that at one time, billions of years ago, Mars was warmer and wetter, with a thicker atmosphere.
                    
                    Recorded observations reach back as far as 4,000 years when the Ancient Egyptians charted Mars’ movements across the sky.
                
                    We have had an international fleet of spacecraft that have orbited and some that have landed on Mars, including the robotic rovers.
                    
                    Strangely, there have been many attempts at sending robotic spacecraft that have failed, but we are pleased to say that many also succeeded including:
                    
                    Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, Opportunity rover, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Curiosity rover, Mars Orbiter Mission, MAVEN and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter.
                    
                    NASA’s InSight arrived on November 26, 2018, with communications support from the twin MarCO cubesats, the first CubeSats sent into Deep Space.</p>

            <h2>Facts about Mars</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>There have been 40 missions to Mars, but only 18 of the missions were successful</p>
            <p>The dust storms on Mars are so large that they are considered to be the biggest in the solar system.</p>
            <p>Meteorites that have been ejected from Mars have been found all over the Earth.</p>
            <p>Of all of the planets in the solar system, only Earth has confirmed life and Mars is believed to possibly be hospital for life.</p>
            <p>Earth and Mars are the only to planets in the solar system with polar ice caps.</p>
            <p>Mars does have seasons but they are twice as long as the seasons on Earth due to Mars’ axis tilt.</p>
            <p>If you were standing on Mars and looked at the sun it would appear half the size as compared to looking at the sun from Earth.</p>
